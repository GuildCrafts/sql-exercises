Challenge: Bobby's Hobbies

We've created a database of people and hobbies, and each row in hobbies is related to a row in persons via the person_id column.

1. In this first step, insert one more row in persons and then one more row in hobbies that is related to the newly inserted person.

2. Now, select the 2 tables with a join so that you can see each person's name next to their hobby.

3. Now, add an additional query that shows only the name and hobbies of 'Bobby McBobbyFace', using JOIN combined with WHERE.

Challenge: Customer's orders

We've created a database for customers and their orders.
Not all of the customers have made orders, however.
1. Come up with a query that lists the name and email of every customer followed by the item and price of orders they've made.
Use a LEFT OUTER JOIN so that a customer is listed even if they've made no orders, and don't add any ORDER BY.

2. Now, create another query that will result in one row per each customer, with their name, email, and total amount of money they've spent on orders.
Sort the rows according to the total money spent, from the most spent to the least spent.

Challenge: Sequels in SQL

We've created a table with all the 'Harry Potter' movies, with a sequel_id column that matches the id of the sequel for each movie.

Challenge: FriendBook

We've created a database for a friend networking site, with a table storing data on each person, a table on each person's hobbies, and a table of friend connections between the people.
1. In this first step, use a JOIN to display a table showing people's names with their hobbies.

2. Now, use another SELECT with a JOIN to show the names of each pair of friends, based on the data in the friends table.

Challenge: Karaoke song selector

Ever sung karaoke? It's a place where you sing songs with your friends, and it's a lot of fun. We've created a table with songs, and in this challenge, you'll use queries to decide what songs to sing. For the first step, select all the song titles.

/* Challenge: The wordiest author

We've created a database of a few popular authors and their books, with word counts for each book.
1. In this first step, select all the authors who have written more than 1 million words, using GROUP BY and HAVING.
Your results table should include the 'author' and their total word count as a 'total_words' column.

2. Now select all the authors that write more than an average of 150,000 words per book.
Your results table should include the 'author' and average words as an 'avg_words' column.

 Challenge: Gradebook

 We've created a database to track student grades, with their name, number grade, and what percent of activities they've completed.
 1. In this first step, select all of the rows, and display the name, number_grade, and percent_completed, which you can compute by multiplying and rounding the fraction_completed column.

 2. Now, this step is a little tricky.
 The goal is a table that shows how many students have earned which letter_grade.
 You can output the letter_grade by using CASE with the number_grade column, outputting 'A' for grades > 90, 'B' for grades > 80, 'C' for grades > 70, and 'F' otherwise.
 Then you can use COUNT with GROUP BY to show the number of students with each of those grades.

Spin-off of "Project: Data dig"
Pick one of those data sets or create a data set like that, and use advanced SELECT queries to discover things about the data. What sort of questions might one have about that data, like if they were using it for an app or a business idea? Here are some ideas:

What are average, max, and min values in the data?
What about those numbers per category in the data (using HAVING)?
What ways are there to group the data values that donâ€™t exist yet (using CASE)?
What interesting ways are there to filter the data (using AND/OR)?
